# Development Log

## 2026-09-14T13:48:12+04:00 — Task 0001 started

- Task: Repository and Python/FastAPI foundation
- Agent/tool: OpenAI Codex using PowerShell, `uv`, pytest, Git, and Docker tooling
- Prompt/reference: `docs/master-instruction.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and the user instruction that initiated autonomous task execution
- Existing work: Preserved the repository directories, bare `uv` metadata, Python 3.13.15 pin, root README, and ignore rules
- Decisions: The Java/Spring `AGENTS.md` discovered in a sibling repository is outside this repository and does not apply; use this repository's Python/FastAPI plan as authoritative; keep PostgreSQL infrastructure in task 0001 and defer Mailpit to task 0011; expose only an infrastructure health route
- Status: Completed at 2026-09-14T13:53:23+04:00
- Result: Added an installable FastAPI backend shell, typed settings, SQLAlchemy/Alembic foundations, feature packages, PostgreSQL Compose service, health endpoint, smoke tests, and architecture/prompt evidence. No domain behavior or frontend tooling was added.
- Failures diagnosed: Ruff found import/formatting issues in generated Alembic code; these were fixed. FastAPI's compatibility `TestClient` produced dependency deprecation warnings; the smoke test now uses direct async `httpx` ASGI transport. Host port 5432 was occupied by an unrelated running container; Compose now supports a `POSTGRES_PORT` override and this project's database was verified on 5433 without disturbing the existing service.
- Tests/checks: `uv lock --check`; `uv sync --locked`; `uv run python --version` (3.13.15); `uv run ruff check .`; `uv run ruff format --check .`; `uv run pytest` (2 passed); `uv build`; offline Alembic upgrade generation; online Alembic upgrade/current against PostgreSQL 17; `docker compose config --quiet`; live Uvicorn startup and `GET /health` (200); Git whitespace checks.
- Self-review: All task 0001 acceptance criteria pass. No Critical or Important findings remain. The only exposed route is infrastructure health, migrations contain no domain schema, and `frontend/` remains uninitialized.
